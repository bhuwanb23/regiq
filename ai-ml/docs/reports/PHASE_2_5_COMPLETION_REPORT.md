# Phase 2.5 Knowledge Graph - Completion Report

## Overview
Successfully implemented Knowledge Graph system with entity relationship extraction, graph database operations, and compliance mapping for regulatory intelligence.

## Completed Tasks

### 2.5.1 Entity Relationships ✅
- **Entity Extraction**: Created `services/regulatory_intelligence/knowledge_graph/entity_extraction.py`
  - spaCy-based NLP entity extraction with fallback mechanisms
  - Custom regulatory entity patterns (regulations, penalties, deadlines)
  - Relationship extraction using pattern matching
  - Support for multiple jurisdictions and entity types

- **Graph Database**: Created `services/regulatory_intelligence/knowledge_graph/graph_database.py`
  - NetworkX graph operations with Neo4j integration
  - Entity and relationship CRUD operations
  - Path finding and subgraph extraction
  - Graph statistics and metrics analysis

### 2.5.2 Compliance Mapping ✅
- **Compliance Mapping**: Created `services/regulatory_intelligence/knowledge_graph/compliance_mapping.py`
  - Regulation to requirement mapping with LLM assistance
  - Compliance pathway creation and analysis
  - Recommendation rule generation
  - Jurisdiction-specific compliance networks

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
1. **EntityExtractor**: NLP-based entity extraction with spaCy integration
2. **GraphDatabaseManager**: NetworkX and Neo4j graph database operations
3. **ComplianceMapper**: Regulation mapping and compliance pathway creation
4. **GraphQueryEngine**: Advanced graph querying and analysis

### Entity Types Supported
- **REGULATION**: Regulatory documents and laws
- **ORGANIZATION**: Regulatory bodies (SEC, FCA, RBI, etc.)
- **REQUIREMENT**: Compliance requirements
- **PENALTY**: Penalty amounts and sanctions
- **DEADLINE**: Compliance deadlines
- **JURISDICTION**: Geographic regions

### Relationship Types
- **REQUIRES**: Regulation requires compliance
- **IMPLEMENTS**: System implements requirement
- **VIOLATES**: Action violates regulation
- **PENALIZES**: Regulation penalizes violations
- **GOVERNS**: Regulation governs domain
- **RELATED_TO**: General relationship

### Graph Database Features
- **NetworkX**: Primary graph storage and operations
- **Neo4j**: Optional advanced graph database
- **Path Finding**: Multi-hop relationship discovery
- **Subgraph Extraction**: Focused graph analysis
- **Centrality Analysis**: Entity importance ranking
