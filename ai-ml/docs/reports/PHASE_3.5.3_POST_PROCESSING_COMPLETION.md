## 🔧 Technical Capabilities

### Threshold Optimization

**Purpose**: Adjust decision thresholds per protected group to satisfy fairness constraints.

**Supported Objectives**:
1. **Demographic Parity**: Equal positive prediction rates across groups
2. **Equal Opportunity**: Equal true positive rates across groups
3. **Equalized Odds**: Equal TPR and FPR across groups
4. **Maximize Accuracy**: Best overall accuracy with fairness constraint

**Key Features**:
- Grid search over threshold space (configurable grid size)
- Constraint slack tolerance (default: 5%)
- Per-group threshold storage and application
- Fairness improvement metrics

**Example Usage**:
```python
from services.bias_analysis.mitigation.postprocessing import ThresholdOptimizer, OptimizationObjective

# Create optimizer
optimizer = ThresholdOptimizer(
    objective=OptimizationObjective.EQUAL_OPPORTUNITY,
    constraint_slack=0.05,
    n_grid_points=100
)

# Fit on training data
optimizer.fit(y_train, y_proba_train, sensitive_features_train)

# Make fair predictions
predictions = optimizer.predict(y_proba_test, sensitive_features_test)

# Evaluate results
result = optimizer.evaluate(y_test, y_proba_test, sensitive_features_test)
print(f"Accuracy improvement: {result.fairness_improvement['improvement']:.4f}")
```

### Fair Calibration

**Purpose**: Ensure well-calibrated predictions across all protected groups.

**Supported Methods**:
1. **Platt Scaling**: Logistic regression on prediction scores
2. **Isotonic Regression**: Non-parametric monotonic calibration
3. **Temperature Scaling**: Simple temperature parameter (ideal for neural networks)
4. **Beta Calibration**: Three-parameter polynomial calibration

**Key Features**:
- Group-specific calibrators
- Expected Calibration Error (ECE) measurement
- Calibration disparity tracking
- Multiple calibration strategies

**Example Usage**:
```python
from services.bias_analysis.mitigation.postprocessing import FairCalibrator, CalibrationMethod

# Create calibrator
calibrator = FairCalibrator(
    method=CalibrationMethod.PLATT,
    n_bins=10
)

# Fit on training data
calibrator.fit(y_train, y_proba_train, sensitive_features_train)

# Calibrate probabilities
calibrated_proba = calibrator.predict_proba(y_proba_test, sensitive_features_test)

# Evaluate calibration quality
result = calibrator.evaluate(
    y_test, y_proba_test, calibrated_proba, sensitive_features_test
)
print(f"Calibration error reduced from {result.original_calibration_error:.4f} "
      f"to {result.calibrated_calibration_error:.4f}")
```

### Equalized Odds Post-processing

**Purpose**: Apply Fairlearn's post-processing techniques for fairness constraint satisfaction.

**Supported Constraints**:
- `equalized_odds`: Equal TPR and FPR
- `demographic_parity`: Equal positive rates
- `true_positive_rate_parity`: Equal TPR (equal opportunity)
- `false_positive_rate_parity`: Equal FPR
- Additional Fairlearn constraints

**Key Features**:
- Integration with Fairlearn library
- Flexible constraint specification
- Randomized and deterministic predictions
- Group-specific metric tracking

**Example Usage**:
```python
from services.bias_analysis.mitigation.postprocessing import EqualizedOddsPostprocessor

# Create postprocessor
postprocessor = EqualizedOddsPostprocessor(
    constraint="equalized_odds",
    objective="accuracy_score",
    grid_size=100
)

# Fit on training data
postprocessor.fit(model, X_train, y_train, sensitive_features_train)

# Make fair predictions
predictions = postprocessor.predict(X_test, sensitive_features_test, random_state=42)

# Evaluate
result = postprocessor.evaluate(X_test, y_test, sensitive_features_test, model)
print(f"TPR disparity reduction: {result.fairness_improvement['tpr_disparity_reduction']:.4f}")
```

### Unified Postprocessing Engine

**Purpose**: Automatic method selection and combined technique application.

**Auto-Selection Logic**:
- Checks for `predict_proba` availability
- Evaluates calibration error
- Selects optimal technique based on data characteristics
- Supports combined approaches

**Supported Methods**:
- `auto`: Automatic selection
- `threshold`: Threshold optimization only
- `calibration`: Calibration only
- `equalized_odds`: EO post-processing only
- `combined`: Multiple techniques

**Example Usage**:
```python
from services.bias_analysis.mitigation.postprocessing import PostprocessingEngine

# Automatic method selection
engine = PostprocessingEngine(method="auto")
engine.fit(model, X_train, y_train, y_proba_train, sensitive_features_train)

# Or combined approach
engine = PostprocessingEngine(
    method="combined",
    calibration_method="platt",
    threshold_objective="equal_opportunity",
    combine_techniques=True
)
engine.fit(model, X_train, y_train, y_proba_train, sensitive_features_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = engine.predict(X_test, sensitive_features_test)

# Comprehensive evaluation
result = engine.evaluate(X_test, y_test, sensitive_features_test)
result_dict = result.to_dict()  # JSON-serializable
```
